## Why use RCO?
  1. RCO not only will do the optimization, but the installation for you. Manual installation is time-consuming and RCO does the work for you.
  2. Any updates we push will automatically be installed upon running RCO. No more manual installations!
  3. RCO backs up your current FFlags before replacing them with ours, allowing you to revert back to your original FFlags.

## Will RCO cause issues with my device?
  No, RCO doesn't take much space nor does it run in the background. It simply changes your Roblox client's FFlags.
