## Why use RCO?
  1. RCO not only will do the optimization, but the installation for you. Manual installation is time-consuming and RCO does the work for you.
  2. RCO backs up your original FFlags before replacing them with ours, allowing you to revert back to your original FFlags.
  3. RCO supports Bloxstrap! You do not need to uninstall Bloxstrap just to use RCO.

## Will RCO cause issues with my device?
  No, RCO doesn't take much space nor does it run in the background. It simply changes your Roblox client's FFlags.
